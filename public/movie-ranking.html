<h1>The Best Movies According to Carl</h1> 

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>F1</h3>

<p>This movie helped me to light the lost blaze of passion. Before watching that movie I felt lame due to several failures and now it's no longer the case for I learn to create my own opportunity in life.
</p>
<h3>Kimetsu no Yaiba : Infinity Castle</h3>

<p>This is actually a manga and an exciting one. People are slaughtered by demons and only the hard trained samourai are able to face and beat the demons. As crimitical the situation can be, I learn the hard lesson that things can only change if you make yourself strong enough to face reality.

<h3>Joseph</h3>

<p>That old movie come from the bible, I was amazed by the strong personality of Joseph when he faced the most difficult situation that was the turnover in his life, where pharaon's magicians were not able to give a meaning to his dream, Joseph did while keeping his composure and the most amazing thing, his faith in God.
